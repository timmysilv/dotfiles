# Dotfiles

Every time I get a new computer, I don't want to start from scratch. This repo installs some handy tools and aliases that I like to use.

## Installation
**WARNING**: This script is written for a fresh Mac. If you're on another system, you might hit unexpected issues.

Run the following:
```bash
./install.sh
```

That's it!
